# Emotional Sentiment Analysis in Python 3.6.5.
NLP Deep Learning project that extracts the emotional state from a given twitter profile tweets, the most likely and unlikely named entities in the same tweets.
As a team of five students, using Keras Sequence models (LSTM Models), we have managed to build a positive/negative classifier with 85% accuracy, an emotional classifier with 89% accuracy and a named entity recognition model with 77% accuracy for extracting the keyword from tweets.
